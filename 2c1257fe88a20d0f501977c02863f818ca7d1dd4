[FIX] crm: migration tolerant lead merge

At commit 13bfc8e, we remove a field that has been dropped in a previous
version.
During migrations between version, the fields are not dropped so similar issue
may appear in the future.
As the content of ir.model.fields may not be synchronised with the content of
self._fields, muse a getattr.
